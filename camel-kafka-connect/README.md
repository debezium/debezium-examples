# Camel Connector for Kafka Connect

The integration framework [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) provides a large set of components that provides a declarative interface to communicate with disparate systems using a large set of protocols.

[Camel Kafka Connector](https://github.com/apache/camel-kafka-connector) is an integration layer between Camel components and the Kafka Connect framework.
This enables the developer to use Camel producers and consumers as a source or sink connector for Kafka Connect.

This example demonstrates a simple IoT integration scenario where Debezium listens on a database table and forwards captured changes into an IoT device using [CoAP protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252).

## Topology

The example consists of multiple components:

* PostgreSQL database that acts as a source of change events
* CoAP server that prints received requests into the console
* Kafka Connect deployment consisting of
  * Apache ZooKeeper
  * Apache Kafka broker
  * Kafka Connect instance with the Debezium and Camel connectors

## How to run

Build the CoAP server and start the example by running:

```
$ export DEBEZIUM_VERSION=1.0
$ mvn clean install
$ docker-compose up
```

Deploy the Camel Kafka Connector:

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8083/connectors/ -d @sink.json
```

Deploy Debezium PostgreSQL Connector:

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8083/connectors/ -d @source.json
```

The CoAP server terminal should contain multiple messages like
```

```

End the application:
```
# Shut down the cluster
docker-compose down
```
