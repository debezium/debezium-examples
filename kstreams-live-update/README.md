# Debezium KStreams - WebSockets Example

This demo shows how to use KStreams to join two CDC event streams created by Debezium,
do some calculation on the joined stream and push the merged events to a client using WebSockets.

The two tables are:

* `stations`: Named weather stations
* `temperature_measurements`: temperature measurements for a station with a value and timestamp

Random temperature measurements are generated by means of the _event-source_ application.
The _temperature-aggregator_ application runs KStreams to join measurements with stations,
group the events by station name and calculate the average temperature per station.

The aggregated values are pushed to WebSockets.
For that purpose, the aggregator application exposes a WebSockets endpoint using WildFly Swarm.

## Preparations

Build data generator application and aggregator application:

```shell
mvn clean install -f event-source/pom.xml
mvn clean install -f temperature-aggregator/pom.xml
```

Start Kafka, Kafka Connect, MySQL, event source and aggregator:

```shell
export DEBEZIUM_VERSION=0.8
docker-compose up --build
```

Once you see the message "Waiting for source connector to be deployed" in the logs,
deploy the Debezium MySQL connector:

```shell
curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8083/connectors/ -d @mysql-source.json
```

# Consume aggregated messages

Once you see the message "WildFly Swarm is Ready" in the logs, open the UI in the browser: http://localhost:8079/.
It shows a chart with the average temperature values which is updated in near-realtime as new temperature measurements arrive via the event generator app.

Alternatively, browse the Kafka topic:

```shell
docker-compose exec kafka /kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
    --from-beginning \
    --property print.key=true \
    --topic average_temperatures_by_station
```

# Shut down the cluster

```shell
docker-compose down
```
